**StickyEncoding**, A high performance binary encoder for `Swift.Codable` types.

## Overview

StickyEncoding facilitates the encoding and decoding of `Codable` values into and output of a binary
format that can be stored on disk or sent over a socket.

Encoding is done using a `BinaryEncoder` instance and will encode any `Encodable` type whether you declare conformance to `Encodable` and let the compiler create the code or you manually implement the conformance yourself.

Decoding is done using a `BinaryDecoder` instance and can decode any `Decodable` type that was previously encoded using the `BinaryEncoder`. Of course you can declare `Encodable` or `Decodable` conformance by using `Codable` as well.

StickyEncoding creates a compact binary format that represents the encoded object or data type.  You can read more about the format in the document [Binary Format](Documentation/Sections/Binary&#32;Format.md).

To facilitate many use cases, StickyEncoding encodes the data to an instance of `EncodedData`.  EncodedData contains a binary format suitable
for writing directly to memory, disk, or into a byte array. Or in the case of decoding, the format facilitates rapid decoding to Swift instances.

### Encoding

To create an instance of a BinaryEncoder:
```Swift
    let encoder = BinaryEncoder()
```

> Note: You may optionally pass your own userInfo `BinaryEncoder(userInfo:)` structure and it will be available to you during the encoding.

You can encode any top even top-level single value types including Int,
UInt, Double, Bool, and Strings. Simply pass the value to the instance
of the BinaryEncoder and call `encode`.
```Swift
   let string = "You can encode single values of any type."

   let encoded = try encoder.encode(string)
```
Basic structs and classes can also be encoded.
```Swift
   struct Employee: Codable {
        let first: String
        let last: String
        let employeeNumber: Int
   }

   let employee = Employee(first: "John", last: "Doe", employeeNumber: 2345643)

   let encodedData = try encoder.encode(employee)
```
As well as Complex types with sub classes.

### Decoding

To create an instance of a BinaryDecoder:
```Swift
    let decoder = BinaryDecoder()
```

> Note: You may optionally pass your own userInfo `BinaryDecoder(userInfo:)` structure and it will be available to you during the decoding.

To decode, you pass the Type of object to create, and an instance of encoded data representing that type.
```Swift
   let employee = try decoder.decode(Employee.self, from: encodedData)
```

### EncodedData

An intermediate representation which represents the encoded data.  This type is the direct connection between raw memory and a type that can be converted to and from a `Codable` object.

StickyEncoding uses an intermediate representation so that it can support many use cases from direct byte conversion to writing/reading directly to/from raw memory.

When encoding of an object, the intermediate representation has already been
encoded down to a form that can be rapidly written to memory.
```Swift
   let encodedData = try encoder.encode(employee)

   // Write the bytes directly to a file.
   FileManager.default.createFile(atPath: "employee.bin", contents: Data(encodedData))
```
There are use cases that require writing to a buffer or socket in which case StickyEncoding offers a direct write method so that an intermediate structure (byte array) does not have to be created first.
```Swift
   let encodedData = try encoder.encode(employee)

   // Allocate byte aligned raw memory to hold the binary encoded data.
   let buffer = UnsafeMutableRawBufferPointer.allocate(byteCount: encodedData.byteCount, alignment: MemoryLayout<UInt8>.alignment)

   // Write the encoded data directly to the raw memory.
   encodedData.write(to: buffer)
```
